EXTRAS:
1 - Telescope command and automatic abi decoding for opcodes
2 - Display if we are taking next jump or not through emulation
3 - watchpoints on storage location or memory
4 - support for multiple transactions
5 - Add explain to see where a value come from
6 - Modifying storage and memory on demand
7 - Visualize logs
8 - cache to avoid burn all the calls for Infura
9 - merge Yon's snapshots
10- undo command
11- ui terminal
12- Support execution of TX from top of block, end, or specific position (more advanced)
    - Executing always at the top might not work in some cases (balance of tokens for a contract)
13- registry should name contracts pulling from etherscan or just manually and display it in callhistory.
14- Decode strings if they look like strings when printing the disassembly or the stack
15- Custom gas for transactions
16- Order sstores and sloads temporarly (otherwise it's impossible to understand in which order this things happened)
17- Probably need this to support Avalanche:
    - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69334835/get-avalanche-block-data-by-block-hash-with-web3-py
18- Collect the pre-image and show them when there is an sstore on a map/array.
19- Printing of storage slots might be too big for some monitors 
20- add dynamic provenance
21- add code_address:storage_address for each log in the log_op

PRIORITY:
1- Avoid to re-execute all the txs to bring the EVM in the right state when replay (snapshot it?) (snapshot + checkpoint)
2- Documentation
3- Polishing!

BUGS:
