EXTRAS:
4- Telescope command and automatic abi decoding for opcodes
6- Display if we are taking next jump or not through emulation
9- watchpoints on storage location or memory
12- support for multiple transactions
21- Add explain to see where a value come from
22- We have to stub ecrecover and every freaking call that expects that the signer was actually a real account when impersonating.
23- Modifying storage and memory on demand
35- do a vmmap command to show current usage of the whole memory!
37- Visualize logs
38- cache to avoid burn all the calls for Infura (LATER)
42- merge snapshots
43- undo command
44- ui terminal
20- Support execution of TX from top of block, end, or specific position (more advanced)
    - Executing always at the top might not work in some cases (balance of tokens for a contract)
27- registry should name contracts pulling from etherscan or just manually and display it in callhistory.

PRIORITY:
39- Avoid to re-execute all the txs to bring the EVM in the right state when replay (snapshot it?) (snapshot + checkpoint)
20- Documentation
25- Polishing!
26- history of commands inter-session
